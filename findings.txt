The `hostname` command returns container ID instead of an ip address when ran inside the containers so host ip is not shared with the containers.

The `uptime` command returns time in UTC so the system time is different inside the containers compared to host machine.

The `ps -ax` command shows only service startup processes so none of the host processes are shared with the containers.

The `df -h` command shows that services do not share the disks with the host system either. The available disk space is the amount allocated to docker hub. We could
share some host volumes with the containers though if we specified the shared volumes inside the docker compose file.
